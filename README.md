### A website report designed to showcase the analysis and results of the Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nocturnal Seizures applications using machine learning.

## About the Repository
Neuro-RPS is a public-facing website report for the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" project developed as part of the "Neurotechnology, Brains, and Machines" course during the Fall of 2023. It is a collection of project analysis, website design tools, documentation, etc. Neuro-RPS was created by, and is the intellectual property of, Priscila Morales and Aissa Conde. Its ultimate purpose is to thoroughly explain the process of creating a classification for Rock, Paper, Scissors and the alternative application of nocturnal seizures through machine learning and computing.
